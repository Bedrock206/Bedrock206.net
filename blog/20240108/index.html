    <h2>On Challenging Morals</h2>
<p>I'd like to think that my morals are rock solid, but nearly everyday they are challenged by the reality of our world.</p>
<p>I love to have this grandoise idea of the innate goodness of humans in my head, but sometimes people do things I can't explain away. I'd love to ascribe all people's motivations to their environments (which can be flawed due to reasons outside an individual's control), but it's impossible to predict what people may do when exposed to certain things. The other side of the coin is that I don't want to say &quot;some people are just born mean&quot;; I don't think that helps anything either. I'm really only one person with one point of view in the end, and I think that's important to keep in mind. It doesn't mean having morals is a futile thing! I still think that assuming the best about people is the right thing to do, even if I get hurt doing that. I'd just rather live my life not second-guessing everyone, trying to read into their feelings towards me. Lord knows I spent enough time and energy doing that already.</p>
<p>Another example: I think about human rights a lot. I'd love a world with human rights for all, no matter what, but the reality of wanting to protect people is that you run into safety concerns, which can be other people themselves. Sometimes protecting the many means harming the few. But I don't entirely feel comfortable with judging who gets human rights or not!</p>
<p>I think the important thing is to be open to people and situations challenging your morals, and be aware when things aren't working. Use these times to reflect on your sense of the world, and think about areas for improvement in your ideology. That being said, don't be completely flexible, and listen to your gut when it comes down to it. The other important thing is that for the present, my morals affect a very very small amount of people, and for that I am glad. I am still a person in progress, and probably always will be.</p>
