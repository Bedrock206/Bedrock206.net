						<p>I loved this movie and I loved the way that it made me feel bad for loving it. Many reviewers had problems with the over-beautification of the shots, but I think it plus the amazing score lead to a brash feeling when you watch the movie. It knows what it's doing and I like it. With every shot looking beautiful and intentional, I'm really able to pick my faves and feel like my taste is refined for it. Here was my favorite shot from the film: (You can click it to view the full-size image)</p>

						<p>Lovely! I also was a big fan of the use of the sky in a lot of shots. When I was in a photography class, I liked to take shots where the subject was in the bottom third and the other two thirds were the sky. Saltburn employs lots of these shots and is sure to mix up the weather and cloud formations to not leave the shot feeling stale. My praise to Linus Sandgren and Emerald Fennell!</p>
						<p>I don't have a lot to say on the plot. I liked having a slow realization that Oliver was up to something, and then wanting him to succeed just to fulfill my morbid curiousity. By the time his plan was done, I felt like scum for ever rooting for him. He did awful things! It's really hard to watch that last montage where he recounts his friendship with Felix. Felix was dumb but was a good friend to Oliver, and I really can't see why Oliver hated him. Maybe because he never recognized the love. Strange way to let him know, Ollie!</p>
						<p>My personal thought on the story is that Oliver manipulated the friendship into happening, and by the time things went belly up he had accrued the skills to bring things to fruition. I don't like the idea that he planned on destroying everyone from the start, it's too evil-genius for a fairly realistic movie like this.</p>
						<p>Overall probably an 8/10 film for me. Watch it with friends, it makes the shocking scenes better, and the socially awkward ones more tolerable. I watched the first half on New Year's Eve and it was very hard to finish at home this morning without constant pausing and cringing into my pillow.</p>
