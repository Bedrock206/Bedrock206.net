    <h2 style="text-align: center;">On The University Engineering Community</h2>
<p>Engineering students are boring as fuck, and it's not really their fault.</p>
<p>Why is this? I've been doing some thinking and some googling and some getting angry in my head, and I think I have an explanation that satisfies me and perhaps only me.</p>
<p><small>(This information is really only relevant to engineering; in my discussions with other students, they are often regarded poorly and spoken of differently than the others. Just thought it was interesting!)</small></p>
<p>Reason one: Engineering majors are implicitly told they are better than others at the UW. I think back to Engineering 101 and how many times the speakers mention their high paychecks, the usefulness of their degree. How many statements they make to the effect of &quot;Well there are other options outside of the engineering program that feed this interest, BUT...&quot; and that's always a big but. Even the engineering peer educators aren't innocent, but I'm not sure what standards they have to comply to behind the scenes so they get a pass.</p>
<p>Reason two: The Engineering major encourages taking classes at a breakneck pace and maxing out your credit load. Your day to day is so packed with technical information and stupid junk that you don't have any time for hobbies or anything. Not making this up, I was able to hear several testimonials from later year students and this was basically the one thing in common. Get used to not having free time.</p>
<p>Third reason: Probably rarer, but a still present group of people who are 18 or 19 (or older!) and think that there's no point to learning a humanity or anything but STEM. I probably had a period where I thought that STEM was the only useful thing to learn. Yeah, back when I was in middle school or something. Grow up, you dorks.</p>
<p>I'm not thinking to leavethe STEM sphere entirely, but I am planning on pursuing a very chill degree and I hear the people in it have some semblance of personality so that'll be nice. Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Anyway the moral of the story is that STEM majors and humanities majors are not enemies. In fact they are kissing, sloppy style, squishing boobs together, etc. Could this all be just a rant because I'm frustrated at trying to make friends in freshman year of college? Yeah maybe. I'm glad I have really awesome friends living near and far and don't feel like I need to start anew.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this crap!</p>
