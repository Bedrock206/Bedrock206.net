		<h2 style="text-align: center;">On Hobbit-Meals</h2>
		<p>Hello again everyone, I know it's been a long time! I was a little distracted by... *gestures broadly*... yknow. The 100 days challenge is very dead at this point, but I'm hoping to get back into writing things for this site, because my friends are doing the same. My pals <a href="https://autumnarchive.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Autumn</a> and <a href="https://neptunesnotebook.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neptune</a> have recently began their own sites, so be sure to check them out! Lots of great stuff there.</p>
		<p>As I always remind my friends, September 22 was Hobbit Day, the anniversary of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins' birthdays. I know it's a few days later and the hobbits are well on their way out of Bree with Strider, but something something a wizard is never late nor is he early. I was lucky enough to eat some great meals that day, both attending a family party and going out for sushi later that night. I'd like to think the hobbits would be proud of me. Anyway, I got to thinking about the seven hobbit-meals (Notice me use the Tolkienesque hyphenated compound noun?!?) and how they would work in hobbit society, and scribbled some notes down, which I expanded on later. I thought they would be fun to share, so enjoy my hobbit-meal headcanon!</p>
		<h3>Breakfast</h3>
		<p>Breakfast is not in fact the most important meal of the day to hobbits. Most will tell you that all meals are important! I imagine breakfast as being eaten during the getting ready portion of everyone's day. For day laborers or farmers this would be pretty early, probably 5 or 6 am and for other members of the household around 7 to 8. Breakfast is made up mostly of prepared foods and leftovers from the day before, such as buttered scones, cakes, dried fruit, leftover. Some breakfast masters pride themselves on seamlessly preparing small snacks while getting ready, for example toasting bread on the same fire they heat the bathwater on. The cooks in the house sample bits from their preparation of breakfast or elevenses foods.</p>
		<h3>Second Breakfast</h3>
		<p>Second breakfast is really what breakfast should be in any household. Held around 9 am, second breakfast is a hearty and nourishing meal featuring many typical breakfast foods and generally with the whole household present. Expect eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms, and biscuits. The steam from hot drinks such as tea and coffee waft over the table. Breakfast is often associated with the most annoying dishwashing task of the day, as many household members will leave soon after this meal to to go work or play, leaving washing up to the few. </p>
		<h3>Elevenses</h3>
		<p>This 11am meal is often packed up and taken on the go, so portable foods are a must. Assorted nuts/berries/foraged items are commonplace, as well as bread, sausage, whole fruits, tarts, and honey cakes. Most hobbits will tell you that elevenses is best washed down with fresh, cold water, but don't expect this of everyone! Elevenses is one of the most social meals of the day, as it is generally eaten with friends and coworkers and is a chance to rest from the warming day under a hedge or beneath a tree. Afterwards, cooks begin preparing luncheon and tea snacks.</p>
		<h3>Luncheon</h3>
		<p>Expect almost everyone home again for 1pm lunch, except for those that work far from home, who will often be hosted by their employer. Hobbits love to have cold cuts, cheese, salads, meat pies, soups, bread, and roasted vegetables at their luncheon. This meal can feel rushed in some households, as everyone wants to get back to their daily tasks, so oftentimes the hosts make efforts to cull the rush with more dishes or a small entertainment. Those who leave again are loaded up with tea snacks for the road.</p>
		<h3>Tea</h3>
		<p>Tea in the Shire is very similar to what tea once was in our world. The main event is drinking copious amounts of tea or coffee with cream and sugar, accompanies by tea-cakes, small pastries, and sandwiches. The smaller scale of dishes for tea makes it a wonderful chance for more artisinal hobbit-chefs to hone or show off their skills. Tea is not always something you go home for, but every day at 3, like clockwork you will see hobbits slow their roll and glance towards the nearest kettle.</p>
		<h3>Dinner</h3>
		<p>As one of the Big Three meals, hobbits will go all out for 5 pm dinner. A Shire dinner is not something to be missed if you are passing through, and often many friends and other family members are invited. Prepare your stomach for a choice meat cut such as lamb, beef, or turkey, served with gravy and a selection of sauces. Small fowl like chicken, duck, or quail, hearty root and vegetable stews, nutty salads and pies, whole vegetables and boiled eggs are typical table sights. The cooks of the household will start preparing dinner meals early in the day, and work on them intermittently during their other tasks. Hobbit meal planners are truly masters of their craft.</p>
		<h3>Supper</h3>
		<p>Supper is a favorite meal of elder hobbits, as it is the one part of the day when their anecdotes and stories are in demand. Supper is the meal most people depart from only when they are headed to bed. Generally center stage is everyone's choice alcohols, often beer or porter, along with foods that pair well like sausages or smoked meat. Younger hobbits or those that dislike alchohol may opt for green tea or a mug of cocoa. Other small snacks include leftover bits of fish, meat, or cheese toasted over the fire, popcorn, and of course, mushrooms.</p>
		<p>How do you think I did? I'm very open to suggestions or corrections, so be sure to let me know if you think anything ought to be changed. I hope reading this made you as hungry as writing it made me!</p>
