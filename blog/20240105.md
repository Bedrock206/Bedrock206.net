<h2 style="text-align: center;">On The Eleventy Migration</h2>

Not much to report tonight, I'm a busy woman. I've decided to try using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> to generate static pages for my site. The idea is that I write these posts in the Eleventy format and then run a script that will compile it all into pure HTML and CSS, which then get uploaded to GitHub Pages, updating the site without me having to change a ton of links and such manually. That's the idea, anyway. I'm optimistic, largely because this is a Node package and I trust Node packages for some reason. It's probably unfounded.

The results are looking good so far. There are a lot of fun tools to play with in this service, and if it becomes unsupported in the future it seems easy enough to migrate to another similar service. I'm tired and have homework and activism tomorrow so this is all you're getting. Bye bye!
